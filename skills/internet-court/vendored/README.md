# Vendored Skills

Committed copies of publicly published agent skills, fetched from their
official sources and pinned in `../skills-lock.json` (source, path, hash,
fetch date, refresh command). Never edit these by hand — refresh from
upstream with the lock file's `refreshCommand` and update the hash
(workflow in `../CLAUDE.md`).

Skills are grouped by owner: each one lives at `vendored/<owner>/<skill>/`,
where `<owner>` is the publishing company or protocol.

Notes:

- Vendored copies are faithful to upstream, including file casing
  (`metamask/smart-accounts-kit/skill.md` is lowercase) and any extra
  upstream files.
- Several skills need provider credentials to act (OKX API keys,
  `CHAINGPT_API_KEY`, `CHAINBASE_API_KEY`, …) — each skill documents its own.
- Review refreshed copies like third-party code before committing: skills
  run with full agent permissions.

## Install into an agent

Copy (or symlink) the skill folders you need into the agent's skills
directory (for Claude Code: `.claude/skills/` in the project), or install
fresh from upstream with the lock file's refresh command.
